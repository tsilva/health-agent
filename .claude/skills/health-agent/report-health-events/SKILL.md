# Report: Health Events

Generate a standardized section documenting recent health events and episodes for provider visits.

## Purpose

This report section provides:
- Active/ongoing health episodes with full detail
- Recently resolved episodes (last 6 months) in compact format
- Chronological timeline with episode grouping

## Workflow

1. Load profile and extract `health_log_path`
2. Extract recent events from health_log.csv
3. Group events by episode_id
4. Classify episodes as active or resolved
5. Format into standardized section
6. Save to `.output/{profile}/sections/health-events-{date}.md`

## Efficient Data Access

### Extract Recent Events (Last 6 Months)
```bash
head -1 "{health_log_path}/health_log.csv" && grep "^202[56]-" "{health_log_path}/health_log.csv" | sort -t',' -k1 -r
```

### Extract Events by Episode
```bash
head -1 "{health_log_path}/health_log.csv" && grep "{episode_id}" "{health_log_path}/health_log.csv"
```

### Extract Context from Narrative
```bash
grep -A 10 "^# {YYYY-MM-DD}" "{health_log_path}/health_log.md"
```

## Episode Classification

### Active Episodes
Episodes are **active** if:
- Most recent event is NOT a resolution event
- Contains ongoing symptoms or conditions
- Has pending follow-ups or treatments

### Resolution Keywords
- resolved, recovered, completed, cleared
- healed, finished, ended, normal
- negative (for test results)

### Resolved Episodes
Episodes are **resolved** if:
- Most recent event contains resolution keywords
- No events in last 30 days AND last event was treatment completion
- Explicitly marked as resolved in health_log.md

## Output Format

The section must follow this exact format for composability:

```markdown
---
section: health-events
generated: {YYYY-MM-DD}
profile: {profile_name}
period: last 6 months
---

# Recent Health Events

## Active/Ongoing Episodes

### {Episode Description} ({episode_id})
**Status**: Active | Started: {date}

| Date | Category | Event | Details |
|------|----------|-------|---------|
| {date} | {category} | {event} | {details} |

**Current Status**: {brief summary of where this episode stands}

---

### {Next Episode}
...

## Recently Resolved Episodes (Last 6 Months)

### {Episode Description} ({episode_id})
**Period**: {start_date} to {end_date} | **Outcome**: {outcome}

{Brief 1-2 sentence summary of the episode and resolution}

```

## Output File

- **Directory**: `.output/{profile}/sections/`
- **Filename**: `health-events-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- **Create directory if needed**: `mkdir -p .output/{profile}/sections`

## Section Header Requirements

For composability with other report sections:
1. Include YAML frontmatter with section name, date, profile, and period
2. Use consistent H1 header format
3. Separate each episode with horizontal rules
4. End with attribution line
5. Use compact summaries for resolved episodes, full detail tables for active episodes

## Event Categories

Common categories to group by:
- **symptom**: Physical symptoms experienced
- **condition**: Diagnosed conditions
- **medication**: Medication events (covered by medication-list)
- **procedure**: Medical procedures or tests
- **appointment**: Healthcare visits
- **lifestyle**: Diet, exercise, sleep changes

## Episode Grouping

1. First, group events by `episode_id`
2. For events without episode_id, attempt to cluster by:
   - Temporal proximity (within 7 days)
   - Related category/keywords
   - Referenced in same health_log.md entry
3. Present ungrouped significant events separately

## Special Considerations

- **Privacy**: Summarize sensitive details appropriately
- **Chronology**: Within each episode, sort events chronologically
- **Context**: Pull brief context from health_log.md for active episodes
- **Provider Focus**: Emphasize clinically relevant events
