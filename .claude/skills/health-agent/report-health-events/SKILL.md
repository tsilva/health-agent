# Report: Health Events

Generate a standardized section documenting recent health events and episodes for provider visits.

## Purpose

This report section provides a **chronological timeline** focused on recent health episodes and events:
- Active/ongoing health episodes with full detail
- Recently resolved episodes (last 6 months) in compact format
- Chronological timeline with episode grouping

**Use this skill when:**
- Preparing for provider visits about recent health issues
- Documenting recent illness episodes and outcomes
- Providing visit context for ongoing problems
- Summarizing recent health activity for follow-up appointments

**Use report-conditions-status instead when:**
- Completing intake forms requiring diagnosis lists
- Annual wellness visits needing condition inventory
- The focus is on condition status (active/resolved) not timeline
- Insurance or disability forms requiring comprehensive diagnosis lists

## Workflow

1. Load profile and extract `health_log_path`
2. Extract recent events from health_log.csv
3. Group events by episode_id
4. Classify episodes as active or resolved
5. Format into standardized section
6. Save to `.output/{profile}/sections/health-events-{date}.md`

## Efficient Data Access

### Extract Recent Events (Last 6 Months)
```bash
head -1 "{health_log_path}/health_log.csv" && grep "^202[56]-" "{health_log_path}/health_log.csv" | sort -t',' -k1 -r
```

### Extract Events by Episode
```bash
head -1 "{health_log_path}/health_log.csv" && grep "{episode_id}" "{health_log_path}/health_log.csv"
```

### Extract Context from Narrative
```bash
grep -A 10 "^# {YYYY-MM-DD}" "{health_log_path}/health_log.md"
```

## Episode Classification

Use the standard status determination keywords and algorithm from `references/status-keywords.md`.

For this skill, apply: **Active/Resolved** for episode classification

### Episode-Specific Rules
- **Active**: Most recent event is NOT a resolution event, OR contains ongoing symptoms/conditions, OR has pending follow-ups/treatments
- **Resolved**: Most recent event contains resolution keywords, OR no events in last 30 days AND last event was treatment completion

## Output Format

The section must follow this exact format for composability:

```markdown
---
section: health-events
generated: {YYYY-MM-DD}
period: last 6 months
---

# Recent Health Events

## Active/Ongoing Episodes

### {Episode Description} ({episode_id})
**Status**: Active | Started: {date}

| Date | Category | Event | Details |
|------|----------|-------|---------|
| {date} | {category} | {event} | {details} |

**Current Status**: {brief summary of where this episode stands}

---

### {Next Episode}
...

## Recently Resolved Episodes (Last 6 Months)

### {Episode Description} ({episode_id})
**Period**: {start_date} to {end_date} | **Outcome**: {outcome}

{Brief 1-2 sentence summary of the episode and resolution}

*Section generated by health-agent report-health-events skill*
```

## Output File

- **Directory**: `.output/{profile}/sections/`
- **Filename**: `health-events-YYYY-MM-DD.md`
- **Create directory if needed**: `mkdir -p .output/{profile}/sections`

## Section Header Requirements

For composability with other report sections:
1. Include YAML frontmatter with section name, date, and period
2. Use consistent H1 header format
3. Separate each episode with horizontal rules
4. End with attribution line
5. Use compact summaries for resolved episodes, full detail tables for active episodes

## Event Categories

Common categories to group by:
- **symptom**: Physical symptoms experienced
- **condition**: Diagnosed conditions
- **medication**: Medication events (covered by medication-list)
- **procedure**: Medical procedures or tests
- **appointment**: Healthcare visits
- **lifestyle**: Diet, exercise, sleep changes

## Episode Grouping

1. First, group events by `episode_id`
2. For events without episode_id, attempt to cluster by:
   - Temporal proximity (within 7 days)
   - Related category/keywords
   - Referenced in same health_log.md entry
3. Present ungrouped significant events separately

## Special Considerations

- **Privacy**: Summarize sensitive details appropriately
- **Chronology**: Within each episode, sort events chronologically
- **Context**: Pull brief context from health_log.md for active episodes
- **Provider Focus**: Emphasize clinically relevant events
